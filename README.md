# US-DAF
A PyTorch implementation of "Universal Domain Adaptive Object Detector" (ACM MM 2022)
## Preparation
Requirements: Python=3.6 and Pytorch=0.4.0

Install Pytorch

Our code is conducted based on [faster-rcnn.pytorch](https://github.com/jwyang/faster-rcnn.pytorch), please setup the framework by it.

## Pre-trained Models
In our experiments, we used two pre-trained models on ImageNet, i.e., [VGG16](https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~jw2yang/faster-rcnn/pretrained-base-models/vgg16_caffe.pth) and [ResNet101](https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~jw2yang/faster-rcnn/pretrained-base-models/resnet101_caffe.pth). Please download these two models.
